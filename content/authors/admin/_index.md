I am a final year undergraduate student in Turing Class, Peking University, advised by Prof. {{% staticref "https://xiongyingfei.github.io" "newtab" %}}Yingfei Xiong{{% /staticref %}}. I also worked with Prof. {{% staticref "http://jhc.sjtu.edu.cn/~hongfeifu" "newtab" %}}Hongfei Fu{{% /staticref %}} and Prof. {{% staticref "https://sites.google.com/site/bingkai314159/" "newtab" %}}Bingkai Lin{{% /staticref %}} this summer. I am interested in problems about programs and programming languages, especially in program synthesis, decision procedures and probabilistic program verification.
